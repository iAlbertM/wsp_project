			<q>"Big things come in small packages."</q>
			<q>"It's the small things that make the biggest difference."</q>
			<p>A firm believer in "less is more". These thoughts have major power within them and they are only made of a few carefully chosen words to make a big impact. This is what I am learning to do for a society that is moving at an exponential pace, providing careful and throughful attention to details that may seem to some, unimportant, but to someone else could be a big deal.</p>
			<p>I collected this library of components to drive my best effort forward to design and deevelop websites that guides engaging user experiences with careful consideration to the tiniest of details to produce a solution. A solution that not only takes care of the stems of the issue but the root of the problem.</p>

				<h3>HEADER</h3>
				<img src="img/Header.jpg" alt="Header Bar">
				<h4>Target Audience:</h4>
				<p>The hair extensions website indicates that it is a site whose target market is for hair industry professionals, already have an established clientelle. That said, the majority are between the ages of 30-50. The choice of a classic white color indicates it's a good mixture of men aand women target but the softer grey ones instead of black for the fonts color tips it in favor of feminine. The modern thin type reinforces the modern look of many of todays hottest celebs. Clear navigation labels, minimalistic style, and ample white space unify the elements together to keep this header easy to navigate, modern and sophisticated, and always looks sharp.</p>
				<h4>Client/User Needs:</h4>
				<p>
					Extracting infformation from the navigation links, one can deduce that this header is one for selling hair extensions and other related accessories (Store).Since this is a list of links the user's goal most likely would be to first find out where they are upon arrival to the site, Hair dressers are always on the go and in a hurry so any signage would help and as you can see the header makes a note to alwasys stay oriented.</p>
				<h4>Critique:</h4>
				<p>The minimalist style along qith the modern look and sans-serif geometic fonts reflects that lifestyle of the hairdresser. No matter where they go, be a Oscar de La Renta fashion show, a high end private salon, or a simple house call, you can be rest assured they will be in a wimple, very clasic, minimal details, just enough to stand out, all black attire.</p>

				<h3>CTA (CALL TO ACTION)</h3>
				<img src="img/landing.jpg" alt="Desktop CTA">
				<h4>Target Audience:</h4>
				<p>Designed as a webdesign tool that designs websites for you, I would say that the target market would be men and women ages between early 30-40 years old, that work with web design and development industry but not necessariy a designer or developer (marketing, pr, advertising, social media strategists). People with the content and always in search of designers. In marketing, pr, and advertising you are constantly having to know what is the latest on any and everything. Staying on top of any eveolution of someting would spark interest and be a founding member--hook line and sinker. That line drives at one of the things they don't really get much, to get something they call their own. Always promoting or talking about somebody else's things or newest something else. Now they can be a founding member of their own project and can help them do their job without hiring extra people? It's a no brainer. </p>
				<h4>Client/User Needs:</h4>
				<p>The client's goal here is to entice and capture the attention of the consume. The "watch the video" button is a way to get information to be consumed quickly and effectively is through video. The human brain can process visual elements (images, symbols, icons, etc) 60,000 times faster than words. The user's goal is to find out what the name of the product is, what does it do, and wants to see it in action in order to give it even a full thought wether to invest a good little chuck of money ($96/year).</p>
				<h4>Critique:</h4>
				<p>The call to action is a successful implimentation to reach its target audience by giveing them the information they seek right off the bat in a clean, convenient, and effortless way. The CTA states what the app does, then invites the consumer to join in so to not get left behind in the dust of yesterdays tech. Catchy and straiht to the point without sounding like a command</p>
