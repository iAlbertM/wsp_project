				<h4>Target Audience</h4>
				<p>Designed as a modern ski resort website, the target audience for the ski resort is consumers within the upper-middle class to upper class income ranges. Primarily couples without children between the ages of 35-45 years old. Couples can have a fantasy getaway and get lost in the romantic thrills and chills of the snowy mountains. They enjoy the time spent away from their executive &amp; high level positions and the hustle and bustle city lives back at home so they can finally get the opportunity to pamper themselves to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor.
				</p>
				<h4>Client's Goals and User's Needs</h4>
				<p>
					Getting away for a luxury vacation takes lots of planning and any hiccups or unplanned events can make a getaway a financial pain. The client’s goals is customer service, they want to ensure the user is well informed of any &amp; all events happening and how to accommodate and maneuver their itinerary if needed. The user’s needs are information while hunting for the best locations to spend their money. The upper-class take good care of their financials and like to splurge when they want and not when they have to. Keeping an eye for unappealing events to avoid any frustrations.

				</p>
				<h4>Critique</h4>
				<p>The sans-serif font type used help cater the content to trendy young professionals living in the modern era. The subtle hints of light blue background give a feeling of cool mint which paints the picture of the icy alps, the fresh biting cold on the edge of your nose, and mint hot chocolate. The large text for the events are used for level of importance and they say, “Hey I’m an event that will be happening this day so if you are traveling here during these days— you may want to read me”. The ample white space is perfect to be seen as the dividers of elements without use of unnecessary design features.

				<h3>Profile</h3>
				<img src="components/2/component.jpg" alt="">
				<h4>Target Audience</h4>
				<p>
					Designed as a photographer’s website, the target audience is going to be graphic designers or web designers, primarily male, between the ages of 20 - 35. This is a website template so the user will have to know just the basics of html to know how to switch out photos and update text content. The designer will be looking for a quick solution that doesn’t cost much so they don’t break their banks and can easily integrate it into their projects.

				</p>
				<h4>Client's Goals and User's Needs</h4>
				<p>Client’s goal is revenue and customer service. The client realizes the need for ready-to-use website elements in this day and age with little time for error so they create website assets that are (for the most part) plug and play ready to use. The customer service comes in when the client is also showing the user the different forms in which they can combine different elements to achieve a layout or feature they might have in mind. The user’s needs are product/service; looking for a fast solution to their project that is nearing deadline and in dire need of a cheap solution that offers a lot of bells and whistles. The website template will have to be easy to integrate and be “mix-and-match” able.


				</p>
				<h4>Critique</h4>
				<p>
					Great use of the energetic and industry color orange. The chunky sans-serif fonts play really well with the bold orange color scheme. The nature photos used throughout the composition adds a natural feel that the right decision is already here. The uniform white text of various sizes establish the information hierarchy quite well and the thin icons and link buttons the component a current modern and fresh feel.

				</p>
				<h3>Navigation</h3>
				<img src="components/3/component.jpg" alt="">
				<h4>Target Audience</h4>
				<p>
					The navigation’s menu using web industry related language suggests the target audience would be mostly male between the ages of 25-35 working in the web design/web development related industry.

				</p>
				<h4>Client's Goals and User's Needs</h4>
				<p>The client’s goal is customer service. They are providing resources to help users accomplish their tasks. The more users complete tasks and interact with this company, the higher the probability of making conversions. The client is also providing options to get in touch and interact with them via their social network profiles. fThe users goal is to find information on the prototyping tools and their features.


				</p>
				<h4>Critique</h4>
				<p>
					The dark blood-orange color of the navigation component gives a sense of high energy, a sense of attraction to the boldness of the color. The sans-serif typeface caters to a younger and more modern user. The social links Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn networks show that the company “N” is up to speed, connects with consumers, and is keeping lines of communication open offering links to three different social networks. Typographical hierarchy is established through the use of white and different levels of transparent white. The logo is styled with 100% white and all the other elements are in a reduced opacity.

				</p>
				<h3>C.T.A. (Call To Action)</h3>
				<img src="components/4/component.jpg" alt="">
				<h4>Target Audience</h4>
				<p>This CTA component is part of a prototyping tool whose target market are female small business owners/business decision-makers ages 30 - 40 years old that are online shopping for prototyping tools.


				</p>
				<h4>Client's Goals and User's Needs</h4>
				<p>
					The clients goal is community service and community outreach. Community service is a goal by recognizing a users need of a particular service and allowing them to try it out and see if it is a service they want to use. This then ties in with Community outreach because they hope to reach as many people as possible and have there services and company promoted by word of mouth, link sharing, and social network posts by users trying the service. The user’s need is a product/service that can help speed up their creative workflow. The user is looking to try out a couple different prototyping tools and find a good fit for their design team.

				</p>
				<h4>Critique</h4>
				<p>A subtle background image sets the tone for CTA, starting off the feeling of strong teamwork and group collaboration. Their choice of hot pink against a cool dark background is bold and definitely grabs your attention, as the color should; hot pink is attention getting and is also used here to represent exciting, fun, and energetic. The client wants to promote their product to small businesses that are wanting to speed up their creative team’s workflow in a way that unifies them more and brings high productivity. This is why the use of uppercase widely spaced and high contrast heading in a white color really helps sell the idea. A great move by the client was a hot pink CTA and logo is a sure way to promote a brand and product as high energy and exciting to those small business owners. The use of a “more details” symbol (the “play” button) is a way to know they are targeting a generation that easily identify graphic symbols and their meanings easily and fairly quick. A clever element of design used here is shape. The downward facing arrow formed from the contrast in color, lengths of the text, and positioning helped shape the direction your focus should be going.

				<h3>Results: Grid view</h3>

				<h4>Target Audience</h4>
				<p>The target audience here is graphic designers, primarily female between the ages of 20-30 years old. She will looking for a way to get her work noticed to land her first job out of graphic design school. Knowing some basics of HTML and CSS she can use a web application to help with the majority of the heavy code lifting and if any minor customization she can handle it herself but needs some great inspiration to help the creative juices flow. She is independent, smart, and knows her strengths and looking at other’s work really helps begin her own website.


				</p>
				<h4>Client's Goals and User's Needs</h4>
				<p>
					The clients goal is to provide good customer service by allowing the works of other designers created using this web application to be showcased. The user’s needs are information, looking for inspiration and ways to implement different ideas.

				</p>
				<h4>Critique</h4>
				<p>
					The soft and delicate light-bluish-gray background color sets the feminine tone. The grid used to align the content give the component firm and strong foundation and structure. The rounded font-type used within this composition add to the soft yet elegant look of the component.
